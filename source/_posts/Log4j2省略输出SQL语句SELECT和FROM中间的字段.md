title: Log4j2省略输出SQL语句SELECT和FROM中间的字段

在项目中，起初我们是不打印SQL语句的，后来为了查问题更方便，就打印了SQL。  
但是也带来了一些问题，比如查询的字段太多，造成满屏SQL，给查日志造成了一定的影响。  
所以我就在想，能不能把`SELECT`和`FROM`中间的字段省略输出呢？

## 线上日志中的SQL
```

```

一大坨SQL占满了整个屏幕，并且日志文件也会变得很大，其实这句SQL有用信息很少:

```
DEBUG : ==>  Preparing: SELECT xxx FROM be_command T WHERE T.REF_APP_NO = ?
```

所以我就想能不能像上面这样输出呢？看下面的demo
